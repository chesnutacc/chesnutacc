# Welcome!

For the record, this is not my *primary* GitHub account, so I apologize in advance if it takes me some time to respond to issues/discussions (or mentions in general). If you found this profile somewhere other than GitHub, you probably already have an idea about what this account is for and (more importantly) why there are no links to my primary account- or my life in general.
